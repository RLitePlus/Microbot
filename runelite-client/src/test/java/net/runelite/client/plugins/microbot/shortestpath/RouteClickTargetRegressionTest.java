/**
 * Regression for the "walker deviates wide / traps itself near Varrock West Bank" bug.
 *
 * <p>The click layer had overshot onto {@code (3176,3428)} — a tile that is <em>not on the raw
 * route</em> — because route selection returned null on a stale anchor and the caller fell through
 * to clamping a far smoothed waypoint to a Euclidean radius. The game then pathed to that off-route
 * tile its own way, which is what produced the wide deviation and the backtracking.
 *
 * <p>The invariant this pins is therefore <strong>"the click target is on the raw route"</strong>,
 * not "the click target is in line of sight". A minimap click is resolved by the game's own
 * pathing, so line of sight is irrelevant to walking — a player clicks past a corner and lets the
 * server route them. An earlier revision clamped clicks to line of sight; that made the walker
 * advance corner-to-corner and was reverted. Do not reintroduce it: if a target sits on the planned
 * route, it does not matter which way the server walks there, because we arrive on the route.
